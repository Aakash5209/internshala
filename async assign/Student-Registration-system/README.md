# Description-
Crafted and implemented a dynamic Student Registration System as a solo project, providing an efficient and user-friendly platform for users to register their data seamlessly.

• Leveraged local storage to ensure persistent data, allowing users to conveniently access their information across sessions.

• Introduced a dynamic scrollbar feature, optimizing the user experience for efficient navigation through extensive task lists.

• Implemented robust field validation, preventing users from adding empty fields and enhancing the overall reliability and integrity of the registration system.

This project showcases my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the utilization of APIs and DOM manipulation for creating a practical and responsive student registration application
